NAME
    Test::Symlink - Test::Builder based test for symlink correctness

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Symlink tests => 3;

        symlink_ok('foo', 'bar', 'foo links to bar');
        symlink_ok('foo' => 'bar', 'Use fat comma for visual clarity');

        # The test name is optional
        symlink_ok('foo' => 'bar') # ok 3 - Symlink: foo -> bar

    Test::Symlink automatically exports "symlink_ok()" for testing the
    correctness of symlinks. Test::Symlink uses Test::Builder, so plays
    nicely with Test::Simple, Test::More, and other Test::Builder based
    modules.

FUNCTIONS
  symlink_ok($src, $dst, [ $test_name ]);
    Verifies that $src exists, and is a symlink to $dst.

    Does not verify that $dst exists, as this is legal, and there is at
    least one valid usage of this that I'm aware of (/etc/malloc.conf on
    FreeBSD). If you want to ensure that the destination exists then write
    this as two tests. For example:

        ok(-e $dst, "$dst exists");
        symlink_ok($src, $dst, "  ... and $src links to it");

    The test name ($test_name) is optional. If it is omitted then a test
    name of the form "Symlink: $src -> $dst" is used.

    Perl's fat comma operator can be usefully used as an visual aid.

    The test will be skipped on systems that do not support symlinks.
    However, the arguments to symlink_ok() will still be checked to ensure
    that they are defined and non-empty.
