NAME
    Test::Symlink - Test::Builder based test for symlink correctness

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Test::Symlink exports "symlink_ok()" for testing the correctness of
    symlinks. Test::Symlink uses Test::Builder, so plays nicely with
    Test::Simple, Test::More, and other Test::Builder based modules.

FUNCTIONS
  symlink_ok($src, $dst, $name);
    Verifies that $src exists, and is a symlink to $dst.

    Does not verify that $dst exists, as this is legal, and there is at
    least one valid usage of this that I'm aware of (/etc/malloc.conf on
    FreeBSD).

    The test name ($name) is optional. If it is omitted then a sensible test
    name will be generated.

        use Test::Symlink;

        symlink_ok('/etc/rc2.d/S72sshd', '/etc/init.d/sshd',
            'sshd starts at run-level 2');

        symlink_ok('/etc/rc2.d/S72sshd', '/etc/init.d/sshd');

    Perl's fat comma operator can be usefully used as an visual aid.

        symlink_ok('/etc/rc2.d/S72sshd' => /etc/init.d/sshd',
            'sshd starts at run-level 2');

    The test will be skipped on systems that do not support symlinks.
    However, the arguments to symlink_ok() will still be checked for sanity.
